# Automerge Quickstart
This is a modified version of the [Automerge Quickstart Repo](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo-quickstart) that is used together with the [Automerge Quickstart](https://automerge.org/docs/quickstart/) tutorial. The original repo had the finished code and didn't really allow for following the tutorial, because the code was already done. This repo is a fork of the original repo, but with the code removed, so that you can follow the tutorial and write the code yourself.

You will need a node package manager to run the app.

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update experiments/automerge-repo-quickstart
cd experiments/automerge-repo-quickstart
npm install
npm run dev
```

Afterwards follow the tutorial on the [Automerge Quickstart](https://automerge.org/docs/quickstart/#architecture-of-an-automerge-app) page.
